ADOPT is one of the well-known algorithms for DCOP problems. In these codes a modified version of ADOPT is been developed for real-world case study.

The watershed of the Kan River and its associated aquifer and the surrounding area covering the west of Tehran city is the study area 

the main code is adopt_shematik_bilan
Others are the fuctions in the main codes and also in each other
